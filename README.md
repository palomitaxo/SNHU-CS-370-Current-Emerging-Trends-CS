-Briefly explain the work that you did on this project?
The purpose of this assignment is coming up with a strategy to navigate through a pirate theme maze. We used a python Deep Q Network to work with two other classes. The pirate character can only move in four directions and is rewarded for successfully reaching the treasure and penalized for hitting obstacles, revisiting the same location, or attempting an invalid move. Through reinforcement learning, the pirate is trained to pick the most optimal action for each state which is done through exploration and exploitation. We were given a starter code and to execute we had to finish the rest of development.

-What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are the ones who design and develop  software and hardware systems. We solve complex problems, create new tech, and work on various applications across many different industries.

-How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I always try to take in the requirements in bite size pieces, when looking at everything, it can become overwhelming so it approach each situation it is best to take it step by step. This can be applied in any situation faced and promotes small accomplishments to even be celebrated.

-What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
We must prioritize user privacy and security and making sure that data is handled responsibly and transparently.  We must carry ourselves with integrity and avoid conflicts of interest and biases.
